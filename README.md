# Eyes

### Description
This repository cotains a cool project that has pair of eyes that follow the location of the mouse with a teal background.

### How to run
Move the mouse around and it will follow wherever the mouse moves. Once the mouse leaves the platform the eyes will stop following. 

### Roadmap of future improvements
This project will improve by creating a more realstic pair of eyes and adding a blinking feature when clicking on the mouse.
